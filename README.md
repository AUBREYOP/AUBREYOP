      Hi :D I'm Aubrey!
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm an 18 year old fullstack developer from the UK! my current stack includes:
      Languages: Python, JS/TS, Go, Rust, C++/C/C#, x86 ASM, Java/Kotlin etc.
      Databases: MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, Cassandra, PostgreSQL etc.
      <br>
      <br>
      Some stuff I'm into includes the following :p
      I really enjoy writing tools that enhance the Windows experiences, especially things
      That make everything a lot more visually appealing.
      I also really like creating CLI tools! I've always preferred TUIs/CLI's over most other
      Forms of GUI's.
      <br>
      <br>
      When it comes to more about me IRL, I'm from the UK studying computer science :p
      I really enjoy a lot about nature, especially plants, flowers and insects, some
      of my favorite insects include butterflies and lacewings :D
